# lcvplayground

An example that shows one how to read in larlite/larcv data, do somethig simple, and write out a larcv image.

To set this up, you need to have installed:

* [larlite](https://github.com/larlight/larlite)
* [larcv](https://github.com/LArbys/LArCV)
* [larlitecv](https://github.com/LArbys/larlitecv): a utility to read/write larcv and larlite files together
* (optional)[pylard](https://github.com/twongjirad/pylard): utility to view larlite/larcv data files


After installation, one should modify the setup.sh script. Change the first three variables to point to your larlite, larcv, larlitecv directories, respectively.  Each time you want to use the example script (or your own) you need to run this script via

    source setup.sh

in order to setup the correct environment variables.
